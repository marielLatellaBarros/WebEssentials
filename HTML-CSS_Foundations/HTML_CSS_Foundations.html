<h2>Writing HTML text tags and CSS selectors</h2>

<!--THE BOX MODEL
Every tag is contained in an invisible rectangle called the BOX.
BLOCK-Level tags take up the entire width of the container,
Such as: h1, h2, h3, ..., p, ul, li, div.
Others are called INLINE-level and they don't take up more space than the one they need...
Such as a, img, input and label.

SOMETIMES, you want block-levels to work as inline...Or vice-versa!

EXAMPLE: you want list items to display horizontally instead of vertically:
take all children from an unordered lis (ul li) and set them to display: inline!
ul li {
 display:inline;
}

THE BOX MODEL has 4 parts:
1. Content area: contains the actual text, images, etc. (h1, h2, p...)
2. Padding: from the content area outwards. Options are top, right, bottom, left.
3. Border: from the padding area outwards. Options are top, right, bottom, left.
4. Margin: from the border area outwards. Options are top, right, bottom, left.

CALCULATE SIZE OF THE BOX:
content area width + padding-left / padding-right + border-left / border-right + marging-left / margin-right

EXAMPLE:
h2 {
  padding: 6px 3px 0 0; //top, right, bottom, left
}

h3 {
 border: 6px solid black; //width, style, color to all sides of the border OR
}

h3 {
 border-bottom: 6px solid black; //width, style, color to only the bottom
}

WHEN TO USE PADDING:
To adjust spacing INSIDE a container.
Used to control the size of a box without changing the size of the content inside the box.
It makes the spaces between one box and the other one just bigger. Content inside does not change.

WHEN TO USE MARGIN:
To adjust spacing BETWEEN containers.


Every browser has a standard stylesheet that adds standard spaces to all the tags we create.
To reset these styles:
html, body, h1, h2, h3, ol, ul, li, a {
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
this is important to start a baseline!


A BOX MODEL sample:
Think of margins, then borders
Start from the highest element <body>. This pushes all the children away from the edges of the <body>.
body {
  padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px;
}

Then move to the most important part of the document, the <h1>. With this margin we put vertical space between tags.
h1 {
  margin: 10px 0 15px 0;
}

Also with other parts of the document to add some "air" between the containers:
h2 {
  margin: 10px 0 20px 0;
}

Also with other parts of the document to add some "air" between the containers:
h3 {
  margin: 15px 0 15px 0;
}

A BORDER for a container can be used as a nice division-line effect!...
h3 {
  margin: 15px 0 15px 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #cccccc;
  padding-bottom: 3px; // this adds a little space between the text and the line :)
}

PADDING can also be used to adjust list and list item indentation!
We want to add the padding to the list, and not to the items inside!
We do this adding a LEFT-PADDING to both ul and ol:
ul {
  padding: 0 0 0 50px;
}

ol {
  padding: 0 0 0 50px;
}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSES
Use "class" attribute to an HTML tag to access it directly in CSS
<ul class="nav"><li>...</li>

in CSS:
.nav {
padding-left: 0;
}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVS AND LAYOUT
A div is a block, this means it will take all the horizontal space available.
But what happens if we want to for example, center a div in the middle of the page?
FIXED-size:
 "width: 500px;"
 The content will automatically re-flow the fit in those 500px-space.
 Center the fixed-size div depends on the type of content you are centering, there are 2 ways:
 1. Center a whole fixed-width block => set left and right margins to "auto":
    margin: 30px auto 0 auto; //the left and right margins are trying to take as much space as they can, and
    by doing this, they're pushing the content to the center.
 2. Center content that is INSIDE a block, for example, a title header, then we need to set the text-align to center:
    text-align: center


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMAGES
There are 3 types of web-images:
1. CONTENT-images: just as necessary as the text to the web-page. For example, On Booking.com, the images of the hotels
                   that help you decide what to book.
2. LAYOUT-images: they appear on the background of the page, but they're not necessary to understand the content.
3. USER-INTERFACE-images: they help navigate a side, not necessarily to understand to content. For example, arrows-down
                   in the Decathlon menu to buy stuff.

An image is created with the <img> tag. Same as <link>, <img> s an EMPTY-tag.
Which image to display? Use the src attribute:
<img src="cake.png">
It makes sense though to put all images in one folder:
<img src="images/cake.png">
Use the alt attribute to put a description of the picture: ==> ACCESSIBILITY
<img src="images/cake.png" alt="Magic Cake Photo">

PROBLEM: What happens when you add an image as part of a list-item?
A list-item is a block, so it will put all the images on top of each other, instead of side-by-side...
But how do we fix it to show images side by side?
We need to remove the bullet points (list-style-type: none;) and the padding set it to 0:
.photos {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
}
Then we need to change the block-style to inline to show the images horizontally,
for all the list-items, and leave some air in between:
.photos li {
   display: inline;
   padding-left: 10px;
}


IMAGES are also used to display a logo
Because an image is an inline-level, it can't be centered with text-align.
WE CONVERT INLINE TO BLOCK! => We need to use display: block and center it with margin: auto.
.header img {
   display: block;
   margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
}

IMAGES as background
They are added in CSS!
There are several properties to consider:
1. Set a background color default in case the background-image fails to load

If a background color is dark, then it makes sense to set a background color to dark grey.
body {
background-color: #5f5f5f;
}

Set the background image (it can be a relative or absolute image)
body {
    background-color: #5f5f5f; /*sets a background color for the body in case the background image fails to load */
    background-image: url(images/pinkDust.png) /* background image source */
    background-position: top left;/* we're taking the small background image and we make it appear in the left top corner */
    background-repeat: repeat; /* if image is small, use this to repeat it all over the page!*/
}

Which is the same as: color image position repeat
body {
    background: #5f5f5f url(images/pinkDust.png) top left repeat;
}

We can also do the other way around, and write on top of a background image.
We ned to create a div to contain this background image and then puts text tags inside of it.


DISPLAY AN IMAGE ON THE SIDE OF A BLOCK
An image is an inline-level tag... But a text is a block-level tag!
How can we make an inline-level tag sit aside of 2 block-level tags? ==> FLOAT

FLOAT
float is going to grant inline blocks "temporary powers" to allow them to take some of that space
the block is fighting for
EXAMPLE:
<ul class="recipes">
        <li>
            <img src="images/cake1.jpeg" alt="Cake Photo">
            <h3><a href="magic-cake.html">Magic Cake</a></h3>
            <p>This is a dangerously delicious cake.</p>
        </li>

in CSS:
.recipes img {
 float: float;
}

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FONTS
 Setup always a default font.
 font-family: Verdana, "Times New Roman" serif;

 Also, set all fonts to their neutral values at th very beginning of the css:
 font-size: 100%;

 Font properties:

 .footer p {
  color: #aaaaaa;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-style: italic;
  text-transform: uppercase;
 }

<div class="footer">
    <p>&copy; 2014 - Recipe World</p>
</div>


Adjusting the space in between the lines of a text ==> "line-height"
It's like the single spacing, double spacing. etc from Word.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATING WEB-FORMS
form - label - input - submit

There are several types of input you can have like, this is a list with the most common ones:
(input does NOT use a closing tag!)

<input type="text"> to write little text
<input type="checkbox"> to select multiple options
<input type="radio"> to choose options
<input type="file"> for file uploads
<input type="password"> everything you write appears with the little black balls
<input type="submit">

How do we associate labels and the input? label + for and input + id:
  <label for="recipe-name">Recipe Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="recipe-name">

What if I want to write more text? use => "textarea" (WITH closing tag!)
 <textarea id="ingredients"></textarea>

Styling labels and input: PROBLEM: these are inline, so they will pile up next to each other.
solution: Treat the as BLOCK.

label, input {
    display: block;
}
label {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
input {
    width: 500px;
    margin-bottom: 25px;
}

This gives a little problem, the submit button is also type input, but we do not want it to get that big...
We can fix is with a special "attribute selector" => these are a way to style a tag based on one of its attributes.
input[type=submit] {
    width:120px;
    font-size: 30px;
}

We can also use this to style the borders of the input text boxes:
input[type=text] {
    border: 2px solid #7facaa;
}


How do we change the size of an input box? Two ways: Or we adjust the font-size or the padding:
1.
input[type=text] {
    border: 2px solid #7facaa;
    font-size: 24px;
    padding: 7px;
}

We do want to show checkboxes next to their labels... how do we do it? Back to inline!
input[type=checkbox], label[for=newsletter] {
    display: inline;
}
-->
